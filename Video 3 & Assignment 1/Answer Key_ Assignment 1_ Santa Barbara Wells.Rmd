# Objectives 

In this assignment, you will learn how to load data into RStudio Cloud, analyze these data for specific parameters, and plot a final figure! 

Data: We are using well water measurements from the U.S. Geological Survey for the Santa Barbara area. 

Here is a map of the wells we are examining:

# Attach Packages and Data 

## Attach Packages 

We attach packages to RStudio Cloud every time we open RStudio Cloud. This tells RStudio to access the packages in R's memory. 

```{r}
# Attach `tidyverse` package. The tidyverse is a large package that allows you to do a lot of cool stuff in RStudio! 

library(tidyverse)

# Disable scientific notation 
options(scipen=999)

```

**Quick Coding Tips:** 

- Start a new code chunk: ctrl + alt + I (command + option + I on mac) 
- ` %>% ` means "and then" to R: it tells R to continue and run the code as one 
- Tip: use keyboard shortcut `ctrl + shift + M` to generate ` %>% ` 
- ` <- ` means "from" to R: it tells R to use what follows it 
- Tip: use keyboard shortcut ` alt + minus sign (-) ` to generate ` <- ` 
- \# in a code chunk means it is annotation, not code (and will not run as code)


```{r}
# Practice using the keyboard shortcuts for %>%  and <-  here! 
# Erase after creating, or your document will not knit (or comment out using ctrl + shift + c) 


```

## Upload Data 

Let's upload the data we will use for this assignment! We are using groundwater well level measurements from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for Santa Barbara. 

```{r}

# Upload data using `readr` package. This allows us to read data into RStudio. 
# We also use the package `here`. This package allows us to specify where R should look for the file (how to navigate folders). 

sb_wells <- readr::read_csv(here::here("Video 3 & Assignment 1", "santa_barbara_wells.txt"))

# Change the site ID column to a character column (so it is recognized as a name, not numbers) using the `as.character()` function 

sb_wells$site_id <- as.character(sb_wells$site_id)

```

```{r}

# Data Analysis 

Our objectives: 

1. Find the longest records of well water levels in Santa Barbara (wells that have the most years of data collection and the most measurements) 
2. Make a visualization of the well water levels from these long-term wells (what has happened to water in the wells over time?)

Our steps: 

1. Find the longest year records 
2. Calculate the median well water record for each year 
3. From those years, find records with the most measurements overall 
4. Plot the well water levels in a visualization

## Step 1: Find the longest well records (most years recorded) 

```{r}

sb_wells_long_records <- sb_wells %>% # Create a new data frame from our original data file 
  group_by(site_id) %>% # Tell R to group by site ID 
  mutate(min_date = min(year), # Create a new column using the function `mutate()`: for minimum and maximum years 
         max_date = max(year)) %>% 
  filter(max_date >= 2015, # Use the `filter()` function to sort by minimum and maximum years for each site ID (well)
         min_date <= 1950) # We want any wells that have measurements from 1950 or before, and 2015 or later (long term) 
  
```

```{r}
# YOUR NAME HERE 










```

## Step 2: Calculate the median well water record for each year 

Some records have more than one measurement per year. Well water levels do not typically change significantly over a period of one year, so we will take the median water level for each year. 

```{r}

sb_wells_median <- sb_wells_long_records %>% # Create a new data frame from 'sb_wells_long_records' 
  group_by(site_id, year) %>% # Group by site ID and year
  mutate(water_level_median = median(water_level)) %>% # Use `mutate()` to create a new column for median water level
                                                      # Use `median()` function to calculate median 
  distinct(site_id, year, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% # Use `distinct()` function to keep only one row for each year, each site ID 
  ungroup() # Ungroup 

```

```{r}
# YOUR NAME HERE 









```

## Step 3: Find long-term records (most measurements)

```{r}
sb_wells_final <- sb_wells_median %>% # Create a new data frame from 'sb_wells_median' 
  group_by(site_id) %>% # Group by site ID 
  filter(n() >= 60) # Use `filter()` and `n()` functions to keep only records that have more than 60 measurements (60 years at least) 
  
# Check how many wells this gives us 
# Use `unique()` function to see how many unique wells are in the site_id column 

long_term_wells <- unique(sb_wells_final$site_id)
long_term_wells

# The result is 4 wells! 

```

```{r}
# YOUR NAME HERE 










```


## Step 4: Plot results! 

Now let's make a visualization that will show us our 4 long-term wells 

```{r}
# We will use `ggplot()` function to make visualizations 

ggplot(data = sb_wells_final, # tell R what data frame to use 
       aes(x = year, # give R the x-axis variable 
           y = water_level_median, # give R the y-axis variable 
           group = site_id, # tell R how to group the variables (by site ID)
           color = site_id)) + # tell R to color the site IDs differently 
  geom_line() + # tell R you want a line graph 
  scale_y_reverse() + # tell R to reverse the y-axis 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "RdYlBu") # specify a specific color palette 

```


```{r}
